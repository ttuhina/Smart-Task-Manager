#Smart Task Manager
Smart Task Manager is a full-stack web application that helps users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a clean, intuitive interface for creating, viewing, 
and managing tasks with different priorities and due dates.

#Features

1.Create new tasks with title, description, priority, and due date

2. View all tasks in a visually appealing list

3. Delete tasks when completed

4. Prioritize tasks with color-coded priority levels (low, medium, high)

5. Responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices

#Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Utilizes modern CSS features like flexbox and gradients for styling,
Implements responsive design using media queries,
Uses Axios for HTTP requests to the backend API.


Backend: Node.js with Express.js

RESTful API design for task management operations,
CORS enabled for secure cross-origin requests.


Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

Stores task data in a flexible, JSON-like format,
Utilizes Mongoose for data modeling and validation.


#What It Achieves
This project demonstrates the implementation of a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js),
minus React. It showcases:

1. Frontend development with vanilla JavaScript, showcasing DOM manipulation and event handling

2. Responsive and attractive UI design using modern CSS techniques

3. Backend API development with Node.js and Express.js

4.Database integration using MongoDB and Mongoose

5. Asynchronous JavaScript programming with async/await syntax

6. Error handling in both frontend and backend

7. RESTful API design principles

8. Basic security practices like CORS implementation

This project serves as a practical example of building a full-stack web application, demonstrating proficiency in both frontend and backend web development technologies. It's an excellent starting point for developers looking to understand how different parts of a web application interact and can be expanded with additional features like user authentication, task filtering, or data visualization.
